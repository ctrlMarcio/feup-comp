# FEUP-COMP

Compilers exercises go here.

This won't have all of the exercises because sometimes I'm plain dumb and I forget them (or delete them _week1 exercise1_ ðŸ‘€), or I just don't make them.

## Installation

- [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) 8 must be enough
- [JavaCC](https://github.com/javacc/javacc/releases) 7.0.4 at most

## Usage

Each exercise sheet is a package with every exercise being a package inside, such as:

```md
/
â”œâ”€â”€ sheet1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ e1
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ e2
â”œâ”€â”€ sheet2
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ e1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ e2
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ e3
...
```

Each exercise has a `build.bat` and a `run.bat` script to ease the execution. With that, the exercises only hold the required files, fully generated files are not presented and are build using the `build.bat` script.
